 Vim 8.1 was released in May 2018.
 The “main new feature” was official support for running a terminal within vim.
 Along with this came a built-in debugger plugin, termdebug,
 which provides a visual interface for interacting with gd

https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace_in_a_visual_selection
--------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Visual selection automatically creates the marks `<` and `>`.
  - Press `'<` to go the first line of the visual selection.
  - Press `'>` to go the last line of the visual selection.
  - Press ``<` to go the first character of the visual selection.
  - Press ``>` to go the last character of the visual selection.
  - Thus, in ex-mode, the prompt `:'<,'>`.
1. The substiution command `:s` applies to whole lines.
   - However, the `\%V` atom restricts actions to the visual selection.
   - Also, the \%>'< and \%<'> atoms are the markers defined by the visual selection.

  Press `^` to go to the first non-blank character of a line.
  Press `_` to go to the first non-blank character of a line.
  Press `0` to go to the first character of a line.
  Unless it's reset, press [count]`|` to go to screen column # {count}.
  Press `g_` to go to the last non-blank character of the line. [Like `$`, not `_`.]
  Press `g0` to go to the first character of the screen line.
  Press `g^` to go to the first non-blank character of the screen line.
  Press `gm` to go to the character occupying the midpoint of the screen.
  Press `g$` to go to the last character of the screen line.
'The Patient Vimmer' writes:
"`0` and `|` are only superficially equivalent."
  - Both `0` and `|` seek the first column of the current line.
    Hover, `|` takes a [count] parameter, whereas `0` doesn't.
"`^` and `_` are only superficially equivalent."
  - Both `^` and `_` seek the column of the first printable character of the current line.
    Hover, `_` takes a [count] parameter, whereas `^` doesn't.
'The Patient Vimmer' writes:
" That's the whole point. That _ has the same effect as ^ in some conditions is a happy accident. A side-effect.
The behaviour of _ is contextual: it depends on how it is used and/or if it is preceded by a count or not. _ without a count has the same effect as ^ when used directly but the effect is different with a count and different in another way if used after an operator and it's even different between operators.
Because it depends too much on its context, _ is ambiguous. Because ^ doesn't care about context, it is unambiguous. And the more precise and the less ambiguous you are, the more likely you are to get your point across or, in this case, to get your editor to do exactly what you want. That's why explicit is always better than implicit: miscommunication is horrible.
Tell her you love her, don't expect her to piece it together out of low-level signaling and impressions and vague stuff. Tell Vim to "move the cursor to the first printable character on the line", don't tell it to " move the cursor 0 - 1 lines downward on first printable character"."
'aktivb' writes:
"No, they are not the same. _ takes a count, and ^ doesn't, as you said. Furthermore, ^ is charwise exclusive, and _ is linewise. So d^ deletes until the last starting blank on the line, excluding the char it is on. d<count>_ deletes the current and count-1 additional whole lines."

"`|` is column movement."

Atoms
-----
atom ::=
  | ordinary-atom
  | \( pattern \)
  | \%( pattern \)
  | \z( pattern \)
Examples of ordinary atoms: (with either "magic" or "nomagic")
---------------------------
\zs                       sets start of match
\ze                       sets end of match
\%^                       beginning of file
\%$                       end of file
\%V                       visual area
\%#                       cursor position
\%'{mark}  [e.g., \%'m]   mark
\%{count}l [e.g., \%23l]  column
\%{count}c [e.g., \%23c]  column
\%{count}v [e.g., \%23v]  virtual column

magic
-----
Use of "\m" after a pattern interprets the pattern as if 'magic' were set.
Use of "\M" after a pattern interprets the pattern as if 'magic' were not set.
Use of "\v" after a pattern interprets the pattern as if very magic (?).

https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Highlight_all_search_pattern_matches
----------------------------------------------------------------
`:nohlsearch` is a command, not an option. It disables highlighting

NOTE:
-----
`set writebackup` instructs vim to create temporary files during file writing.
E.g., before writing to "file0",
      vim might create a file called "1234".
      vim would then write changes to "file0"
      and only at that point delete the temporary file "1234".
Because so many files actions are done,
this process can interfere with any programs that use 'inotify' (e.g., spago).
To toggle locally:          `setlocal writebackup!`.
To turn off locally:        `setlocal nowritebackup`.
To check activation status: `set writebackup?`.


/<Ctrl-R>0 # To put contents of register 0 (yank register) into register / (search register).
More generally:
/^R{register} # To put contents of register {register} into the / register.

Multi-line regex:
`\_.` means "match any single character including newline".
Here's an example of searching for 'This' and 'text', possibly separated by multiple lines:
      /This\_.*text/

In vim 8.0, you can select a range of lines and run :terminal bash. This will open a terminal running bash with your selection as stdin.
:terminal node, :terminal ruby, :terminal python seem to work nicely as well.
