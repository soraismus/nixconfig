          # # Denite is a plugin for Neovim/Vim to unite all interfaces.
          # # It can replace many features or plugins with its interface.
          # # It is like a fuzzy finder, but is more generic.
          # # Features: opening files; switching buffers; inserting the value of a register; searching for a string
          # # cf. !gh/Shougo/unite.vim
          # # Note: Active development on denite.nvim has stopped. The only future changes will be bug fixes.
          # # Please see ddu.vim.
          # # The unite or unite.vim plug-in can search and display information from arbitrary sources
          # # like files, buffers, recently used files or registers.
          # # You can run several pre-defined actions on a target displayed in the unite window.
          # # The difference between unite and similar plug-ins like
          # # fuzzyfinder, ctrl-p or ku
          # # is that unite provides an integration interface for several sources and you can create new interfaces using unite.
