- Have rxvt_unicode titlebar's caption match $PWD
  for all states of rxvt_unicode, i3, and tmux.
  (I.e., currently, when in tmux, the terminal's title is not updated. Instead,
  it persists as the last title before starting tmux.)
- Consider changing "${pkgs.bash}/bin/bash" in 'execute-namespace/default.nix'
  to "${pkgs.stdenv.shell}" or just "${stdenv.shell}".
  Or consider using 'writeShellScriptBin' instead of 'writeScriptBin'.
  ('writeShellScriptBin' has two advantages:
      0. Including a hashbang is unnecessary.
      1. It calls `${shell} -n ${script}` to perform a simple syntax check.)
- Checkmark and 'invalid' X don't render -- perhaps b/c of font incompatibility
- Refactor/restructure 'configuration.nix' into multiple more-specific
  configurationally-contained components.
- Transition from $HOME to $CONFIG_ROOT.
- Boyscout i3/default.nix, graphical/Xresources.
- Create a directory dedicated to swapfiles like $CONFIG_ROOT/vim/undoDir.
- Move "$CONFIG_ROOT/.viminfo" to "$CONFIG_ROOT/vim/.info".
  (the dot to indicate non-directory)
- Move "$CONFIG_ROOT/.tmux_history" to "$CONFIG_ROOT/tmux/.history".
  (the dot to indicate non-directory)
- Change the schema of bash history files to include a prefixing dot.
  (the dot to indicate non-directory)
- Rewrite bookmark/definition to indicate its dependency on 'pandoc'.
- 'bookmark/default.nix' indicates that 'pandoc' is a dependency;
  however, should 'bookmark/definition' be written to indicate this dependency too?
- Boyscout swap and un~ files as well as directories not needed in the master branch.
- Consider renaming $NAMESPACE as $REGION, $BASH_SPACE, or $CLOSURE.
- Namespaces are currently volatile; consider incorporating them into
  static nixos management.
