# Easy PureScript Nix, NixOS Readyâ„¢

A project for using PureScript and related tooling easily with Nix. Note that the `purescript` derivation used in nixpkgs is a derivative of the derivatifrom this project, so if you do not care about which version of PureScript you want to use, you can simply use it from there.

## Example usage

See [ci.nix](./ci.nix) in this repo for example `nix-shell` usage.

## Potential questions

### How do I install to my system from here?

Behold:

```
> nix-env -f default.nix -iA purs
# or nix-env -if purs.nix

> which purs
/home/justin/.nix-profile/bin/purs
> purs --version
0.13.2
```

Or in your own Nix expressions instead:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  easyPS = import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "justinwoo";
    repo = "easy-purescript-nix";
    rev = "<some-rev-here>";
    sha256 = "<some-sha-here>";
  }) { inherit pkgs; };
in {
  inherit (easyPS)
    purs;
}
```
